# "Whitespace" by Prismbeings

A 4k intro (compresses to 3900 bytes with Crinkler 2.0) released at Simulaatio 2016. Download Crinkler from http://crinkler.net/ and place it as "link.exe" at the root of the project*. Both the original shader and minified are included. Compiled under VS2013, should work on newer versions as well. See releases for a compiled version.

AO solution based on XT95's "Hemispherical SDF AO": https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4sdGWN

(* Not needed to compile the project, but essential to produce an actual sub 4 kilobyte executable.)
